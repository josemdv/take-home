<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wrote this simple project in a few hours for a take-home assignment. The project contains three scripts:
* assesment1.py generates a report that shows the number of files and folders in total for the source folder.
* assesment2.py is a script to create a report that shows the number of files and folders for each folder under this folder id (recursively) and a total of nested folders for the source folder
* assesment3.py is a script to copy the content (nested files/folders) of the source folder to the destination folder -  [90% complete]

### Built With

These scripts contain its own modules plus some extra frameworks/libraries. Here are a few examples.

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Google API Python Library](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client)
* Google Auth HTTP Library
* [Google OAuth Library](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth-oauthlib/)

        <img src="images/image8.png" alt="CreateProject" width="200"/><br><br>
     * Click on Create and select *Download JSON*
     <br><img src="images/image10.png" alt="CreateProject" width="200"/><br>
     * **Rename** the file that just downloaded to: 
        ```js
         credentials.json
         ```


5. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jose/xxx.git
   ```
6. Move the *credentials.json* file to the root folder of the recently cloned repo.
7. Make sure to install all modules and packages by using pip3. For example:
    ```pip3 -r requirements.txt```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Simple! Follow the installation steps, and once completed, you should be able to run the following command on your machine:

```python3 assesment{1,2,3}.py```

Remember that you will need to install all dependencies (as stated above). It's highly recommended that you create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to install all requirements.

<!-- TODO -->
## TODO

- [ ] Complete function to assign files to the right parents - the mapping is already done, we just need to iterate through each file recursively and use the Google Drive update method.
- [ ] Add additional logging for debugging.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/josemdv/take-home/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
